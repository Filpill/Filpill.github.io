      <title>Web Scraper - Valorant Data Analysis</title>

      <description>Summary I was originally looking for a Valorant API to analyse some of my own match data, however Riot games do not hand out personal API keys for this game.
I figured I could scrape some of my own match data which is publically available on the web client side.
Though the data is fairly limited due to built in limitations of the Riot Valorant API. The website only pulls 30 matches worth of data.</description>

      <description>Summary  I decided to showcase some data transformations on I game that usually play and see if I could get some cool visualisations/insights. I&amp;rsquo;m using an API to replicate a sample of data visualisations I would typically make. In my work I normally query out of a SQL database for my data ingestion but trying something new here as an experiment. This was my first time using an API to extract JSON data, but its very easy to manipulate on Python to transform into a dict/dataframe.</description>
