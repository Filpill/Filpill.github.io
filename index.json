[{"categories":["engineering","design"],"contents":"Summary Finshed designing and building a functional RC car (which now appears to be more akin to a tractor) which is mostly 3D Printed.\nThe reason for the large wheels in the back is because of how I started my design process. The design was built around the gearbox. Since the gearbox ended up being very tall, I figured I would just mount some very large wheels to clear the ground. Therefore I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to think about mounting points for the rear wheel, nor did I need a drive shaft with a CV joint, it was simply direct drive.\nI wanted to make my design as simple as reasonably possible. In my previous projects, trying to implement a suspension was fairly complicated and I had limited spare time I had outside of my 9-5. My only goal was to get a suitable functional prototype car.\nI did end up using the lessons from my previous failed car designs to incorporate into this one. I had a 2 year hiatus from designing anything mechanical, so I suprised even myself when I managed to get a working 3D printed gearbox for instance.\nNot sure what my future plans will be, but I will endeavor to make a more elegant design with improved tolerances. Even after 4 years of 3D printing, its not straightforward to nail down the tolerancing, but at least its at the point of acceptability.\nGeneral Car Stats Dimensions: Approx. 300mm x 230mm Weight: Approx 1.2kg (including electronics) Motor: 550/35T Battery: 11.1V 3S LiPo Servo: MG995-R Plastic Used: PLA Design Photos Here are some renders made in Solidworks:\nFront View Side View Top View Front Wheel Hub - Close Up Gearbox - Close Up Steering Articulation ","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/eng_projects/rctractor/","tags":["design","engineering","mechanical","3d-printing"],"title":"3D Printed RC Tractor"},{"categories":["engineering"],"contents":"Summary This article will briefly outline the basic arrangement that can be used as guidance for your DIY RC electronics. Should be relatively plug and play.\nParts List Any of these specific parts that are mentioned here can be interchanged for your specific needs. The list of parts outlined is the minumum number of components to have a functioning motor and servo.\nComponent Part No. Radio Controller/Transmitter FS-GT5 Radio Reciever FS-BS6 Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) KYRC X60 - Brush Battery Eliminary Curcuit (BEC) KYRC X60 - Brush Lipo Voltage Indicator Youmile Battery Tester Brushed/Brushless Motor 550/35T \u0026ldquo;CrazyPony\u0026rdquo; Brushed Servo MG-996R LiPo Battery 11.1V 3S HRB Power Battery Balence Charger/Discharger HTRC T150 Type of Electrical Connectors These are the electrical connectors used in these components.\nComponent Connector(s) ESC Traxxas, Deans, Motor Pin, Futaba Battery Traxxas, Deans Motor Motor Pin Servo Futaba Voltage Alarm JST XH Balance Charger JST XH Typically the battery connectors can come in a number of varieties which can make the matter confusing. However, you always have the option of hooking up and adapter.\nIn my case, I had to use as Deans (male) to Traxxas (female) adapter to complete the circuit.\nBlock Diagram - Connections Here is the component block diagram:\nmindmap root((ESC)) Motor BEC Reciever Servo Battery Voltage Indicator The ESC as the hub of the system in which everything connects to. The ESC on my system also happens peform the functionalilty of the BEC and can be considered as one unit.\nRadio The bought the radio Rx/Tx system as a package, so they came \u0026ldquo;bound\u0026rdquo; together already. The system was plug and play for me. As long as I could supply a current to the reciever, it automatically connect to the transmitter.\nIf you do not have binding (or need to use a new reciever), there are usually specific procedures to follow for your given controller to bind them together (in the manual for the controller).\nThere are no complicated procedures outside of this, you just need to follow the block diagram and make sure the components are rated for the supplied voltage/current.\nThe radio controller I used was a 6 channel.\nFor reference my servo was plugged into Channel 1 (CH1), my ESC/Motor was plugged into Channel 2 (CH2).\nThere are still 4 empty channels open, therefore, other electronics such as additional servos can supplement your RC controls.\nLiPo Battery Maintenance Safety Precautions should be taken when using LiPo batteries, they can be very dangerous if mishandled.\nStorage If you are not using the LiPo\u0026rsquo;s when they are in a \u0026ldquo;charged\u0026rdquo; state, then you should consider discharging them to a \u0026ldquo;storage voltage\u0026rdquo;. A safe storage voltage per cell is somewhere between 3.6V and 3.8V.\nCharging The maximum allowable voltage of a LiPo cell is 4.2V per cell. Do not overcharge the battery as you may cause damage to the battery and reduce the lifespan; it may also become a fire hazard if consitently overcharged.\nIn terms of charging rates, I am charging my batteries at a rate of 1C. For a 2200mAH battery this equates to 2.2A.\nDischarging The inverse is true about discharging the battery too much. Do not let the LiPo voltage fall below 3.2V per cell as this will also cause internal damage to the battery which is irreversible. To mitigate this risk, you can use a voltage alarm on your circuit to warn you when the voltage is falling below a desired threshold.\nSigns to Discontinue Battery Usage A well maintenaed LiPo battery should be able to safely achieve at least 300 full charge/discharge cycles if obeying the precautions above.\nThere are a list of signals decide whether or not to discontinue use of any given LiPo:\nIf you see ballooning occur in the battery. Battery not holding a charge and voltage drop-off. Battery getting warm when charging at a rate of 1C. Physical dents or damage to the battery increasing the internal resistance. Gifs Following the block diagram, you should be able to achieve these results.\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/eng_projects/rcsetup/","tags":["engineering","electronics"],"title":"How to Set Up Your Radio Controlled System"},{"categories":["engineering","design"],"contents":"Summary Designed a skateboard for my GoPro, experimenting with different camera perspectives; in particular with low rolling shots.\nThe camera mount point is not ideal as the wheels are caught in the field of view\u0026hellip;It\u0026rsquo;s not too bad, but still a little bit distracting when shooting a wide angle.

Network configuration is not in the scope of this guide if you are installing on bare metal.\nThe motivation behind this web page is to keep some guidance material for myself and also for anybody new looking to install Arch from scratch.\nThe virtual machine is made with Microsofts Hyper-V program. The steps may differ slightly if you choose to use a another hypervisor such as VirtualBox.\nArch Linux ISO Download Link You can find the download link to the Arch Linux ISO here: https://archlinux.org/download/\nThe recommended way to pull down the ISO file is by torrenting it from the referenced magnet link.\nWhen the download is complete, you can configure your virtual machine.\nCreating a Virtual Machine The first step is to open up Hyper-V and create a new virtual machine You will be asked which generation of VM to create. I would reccommend to select \u0026ldquo;Generation 2\u0026rdquo;. It supports UEFI firmware and it should be better from a cyber-security standpoint. You can specify how much memory to allocate to the VM. I decided to allocate 4000MB in my use case. Hyper-V has a built in network adapter that works out of the box, so you\u0026rsquo;d want to select \u0026ldquo;Default Switch\u0026rdquo; to have it enabled. For the VM you should create a virtual hard disk to store the data. I decided to allocate 30GB of storage space. You need to select the arch linux ISO file to boot from and then you can finalise the VM creation. We are not done yet, we still need to configure 2 more things in the settings panel of this VM we just created. We need to disable Secure Boot, if you do not do this step, it will interfere with your ability to boot the ISO image. Next we need to bump the Hard Drive to the first priority of boot loading. Its very important that you do this step before you start installing linux otherwise the Grub will fail down the line because it will be trying to boot from the DVD Drive. You will not be able to retroactively change the boot order at a later stage. After applying the changes:\nConnect to the VM Start the VM Booting From Arch Linux ISO Image From this screen select the highlighted option to load the ISO image The install process starts here: Before going any further, you should test that your internet connecting works. You can use the ping command to run the test to any website:\nping archlinux.org Hyper-V should be providing your VM with the internet connection in anycase. If not, you will probably need to configure Hyper-V to alleviate networking issues. We also need to synchronise the systems clock with the network time, this command will enable that for you. Drive Partitioning and Filesystems Now we need to start partitioning our drives and creating our filesystem.\nIf you type \u0026ldquo;lsblk\u0026rdquo; you can see which drives and partitions are on your system. We want to \u0026ldquo;cfdisk\u0026rdquo; into \u0026ldquo;/dev/sda\u0026rdquo; which effectively our hard disk. At this juncture we need to assign the disk label type and it comes down to two options mainly:\nIf your hardware is new and your hard drive is over 2TB, then the recommendation is to use gpt. If you don\u0026rsquo;t fulfill the above conditions, then the recommendation is use dos. In our case we are using dos. There are many partition schemes to choose from, but I will keep it simple and only include the boot patition and root parititon:\n/dev/sda1 (boot partition) only needs about 128MB of space and needs to be bootable. You can press b to enable the boot flag after making the parition. /dev/sda2 (root paritition) can be assigned the remaining space of the disk. Write the changes and quit out of cfdisk. If you lsblk now, you will now see that 2 paritions have been made, sda1 and sda2. You will need to make a directory with this path: /mnt/boot/efi which can be done with the mkdir command. We are creating a mount point for the boot partition. Normally you don\u0026rsquo;t need the efi folder, but its necesarry here since we have a UEFI system config.\nWe also need to make the file systems for each parition sda1 is FAT filesystem and root is ext4.\nRun these commands:\nmkfs.fat -F /dev/sda1 mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 Now the mounting procedure MUST go in a specific order:\nsda2 (root) is mounted first to /mnt sda1 (boot) is mounted second to /mnt/boot/efi mount /dev/sda2 /mnt mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi I can\u0026rsquo;t explain the reasoning, but if you do it in reverse, the install will fail down the line. You will have to ignore the order of the commands in image as I remounted in the afforementioned order later. At this point you are ready install the base tools for the system as well as the linux kernel.\nUse the pacstrap command to install the following tools to /mnt Next you want to generate your fstab configuration. Run the following command: Chrooting into Arch Install At this stage we chroot into our installation filesystem/environment by running this command: Pacman is our package manager and we can use it to install \u0026ldquo;networkmanager\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;grub\u0026rdquo; as follows.\nNetwork manager is a program for managing our internet capabilities and grub is our boot loader. We can use systemctl to enable network manager as a service which starts automatically when you boot the computer (which is very useful to have). We also need to install \u0026ldquo;efibootmgr\u0026rdquo; as this is a dependancy for grubs installation. Next we run the grub-install command on /dev/sda\nIt should run with no errors. We need to make a config file for grub, which is done using the following command:\ngrub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg We need to vim into this grub file and make an edit to it. We need to uncomment the line \u0026ldquo;GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false\u0026rdquo; and then save the file. Run the passwd command to set a root password for the machine Then we want to vim into /etc/locale.gen to change the language settings of the machine. Uncomment the lines that apply to your language of choice. Run \u0026ldquo;local-gen\u0026rdquo; command to generate the locales you have selected. Vim into a new file called /etc/locale.conf and set the language being used. Type in the language. Vim into /etc/hostname The word you type in here will be the name of your computer. Type the below command to set up the local time zone of your system. Greenwich can be substituted for any region within that zoneinfo folder. Rebooting the System At this stage we should be ready to reboot the system. We need to exit out of the root environment. Then we need to unmount all the partitions and reboot the system.\nType all the commands as follows: If successful you should be greeted with this screen. You can select \u0026ldquo;Arch Linux\u0026rdquo; to boot into the system. And you should see a tty apper on your screen. Since we do not have any users set up on the system, we can only login as root for the time being. So you can just enter the root credentials. That\u0026rsquo;s about it, you now have a base install of Arch Linux. From this point you are free to customise your desktop to your liking.\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/arch_install/","tags":["Linux"],"title":"Arch Linux Installation Guide"},{"categories":["data"],"contents":"Summary I\u0026rsquo;ve played a decent number of chess games on the chess.com platform since 2019 and all my chess data can be explored using the API endpoints documented inside the website.\nI was interested in monitoring my rating change over the cumalative number of games played.\nLink to the project here: Chess.com - Python Analysis\nAnalytics Process Flow graph TD; subgraph Process Initiation 0([Python Notebook Executed])--\u003eA[HTTPS Request Chess Username Stats] end subgraph Data Extraction A--\u003eB[Requesting List of Month Endpoints] B--\u003eC[Request List Games For Each Month Endpoint] C--\u003eD[Unpack all Games into Dataframe] end subgraph Data Cleaning D--\u003eE[Filtering to Blitz Chess Games] E--\u003eF[Cleaning pgn Chess data\nand Merging Additional Attributes] F--\u003eG[Extracting Player Ratings\nand Game Results] G--\u003eH[Curating List of Columns] end subgraph Data Aggregation H--\u003eJ[Top Openings] H--\u003eK[Time of Day] H--\u003eL[Monthly Volume] H--\u003eM[Game Result] end subgraph Visualisation J--\u003eN[Graphing Openings] K--\u003eO[Graphing Time of Day] L--\u003eP[Graphing Monthly Volume] M--\u003eQ[Graphing Game Result] end subgraph XlsxDashboard N--\u003eR[Insert and Format Tabular Data] O--\u003eR P--\u003eR Q--\u003eR R--\u003eS[Insert Matplotlib Charts] S--\u003eT([Close Xlsxwriter Workbook Object]) end Data Visualisations The following images are served directly from my github repository:\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/chess/","tags":["python","data","programming","webscraping"],"title":"Chess.com API - Data Visualisation"},{"categories":["programming"],"contents":"Summary A game where you test your luck: Pick some numbers and try to win!\nLink to github project: https://github.com/Filpill/lottery-game\nLottery Algorithm flowchart TD; subgraph Lottery Algorithm start(Pick \\nLottery Numbers) --Check--\u003e check{Are the \\ninputs valid?} check --Yes--\u003e draw[Generate Randomised\\nLottery Draw] check --No--\u003e start draw --\u003e match{Do Picks Match the\\n Lottery Draw?} match --Yes--\u003e win(Winner!) match --No--\u003e reroll[Chance to reroll\\nthe incorrect numbers] reroll --\u003e check2{Did you hit any\\n more correct picks?} check2 --No--\u003e lost(Loser!) check2 --Yes--\u003e check3{Are they\\n all matching?} check3 --No--\u003e reroll check3 --Yes--\u003e win end ","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/page_archive/lottery/","tags":["python"],"title":"Python Lottery Game"},{"categories":[],"contents":"Summary I\u0026rsquo;ve made a Tableau Public profile to showcase any public datasets I\u0026rsquo;ve analysed in Tableau:\nLink to Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/filip.livancic\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/page_archive/tableau_public/","tags":[],"title":"Tableau Public Profile - Filip Livancic"},{"categories":["programming"],"contents":"Summary I\u0026rsquo;ve been very involved in practising my programming skills in python and sql lately on codewars.\nI figured it would be a good idea to visualise my codewars progression.\nI\u0026rsquo;m utilising the codewars public API to pull out my information.

The only drawback is that there is no way to pull out the individual charts from the dashboard view via this API. Therefore you need to specify all the pixel dimensions to crop the images into their respective charts.\nThe only alternative is to implement a web-scraping technique on Tableau Server and figure out a way to pull down the chart data. It would probably require something like Selenium because of the dynamic nature of the website.\nRegardless, with the Tableau Client Server API you will still benefit from the dashboard image extraction in addition to allowing you to repurpose your existing dashboards for presentation purposes.\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/tableauapi/","tags":["python","tableau","automation","programming"],"title":"Tableau Client Server API: Extracting Dashboard Images"},{"categories":["data","programming"],"contents":"Summary There are endless oppertunities to streamline processes and automate our data production tasks.\nThis article serves as an example for the wide ranging applications I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Python to automate both simple and complex tasks with high efficiency.\nData Pipelines These are some of the goals we are trying to achieve:\nTo build complete end-to-end data solutions from the data source to user. We want to minimise manual task interventions during the data processing. To build tools which are adaptable to the needs of the business.

I\u0026rsquo;ve saved much time inter-weaving these python libraries together.\nAs long as the tools are well built, you can bridge them across to new processes easily and maintain them with minimal effort. Not to mention you will be saving hundreds (and maybe thousands of) hours as you execute these processes.\nThe idea is not to replicate this system one-to-one, but to demonstate the possibilities for connecting automation tools togther.\nAnd perhaps we can learn to make more elaborate systems\u0026hellip;\nPyODBC - A SQL Interface For Python The most important setup of the automation process is the ingestion of data into the Python environment.\nFortunately for myself, our organisation hosts several Microsoft SQL Servers which form part of our data warehouse.\nPyODBC is a python module which can authenticate and connect directly to your desired SQL server. The great thing about it is that you can wrap an entire query written in SQL with a triple quote string directly within your python script. The module will be able to send the query out using the relevant ODBC driver on your machine.\nThe pyodbc set-up can be generalised because you only need two inputs: the server name and the sql query. Therefore I have developed a python utility written which can be imported into any data processing script as a module.\nXlsxWriter - Excel Report Generator For Python The proliferation of Excel as a standard piece of software has enabled much easier sharing and communication of data. There is no office computer in the world that is not supplied with Excel.\nBI tools are also used to communicate and share data accross the business. However, this depends on how much the organisation can stretch the budget to license the majority of individuals.\nWorking inside the Excel ecosystem can help save on the extra overhead. However, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to be doing any analysis in Excel.\nWhy?\u0026hellip;\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s extremely computationally expensive to handle large data sets. And its next to useless when stringing together a series of complex formulas to analyse data.\nHow can we solve this issue? Simple \u0026ndash; Xlsxwriter.\nXlsxwriter is a python module which allows you to create fresh Excel reports from scratch with analysis conducted in Python. You can turn all your pandas dataframes into Excel tables. Additionally, matplotlib charts can be inserted into the workbook to act as the visualisation component.\nWith a bit of effort, you can easily turn the analysis into a dashboard that mimics the appearance of an Excel spreadsheet. I frequently use this tool to get dashboards into production quickly with python.\nNote: XlsxWriter as the name suggests \u0026ldquo;writes Excel Workbooks\u0026rdquo;. To be clear, this is not an API that can directly interact with objects of pre-existing workbooks. Everytime you execute a script with xlsxwriter tools involved, a completely new file will be produced and overwrite the previous version.\nPython-Pptx - PowerPoint Presentation Generator For Python How many hours do you waste making powerpoints? I\u0026rsquo;ve spent countless hours adjusting trivial features such as formatting or chart positioning.\nBut what if the presentation content and design can be prepared automatically?\nI generate tens of presentations per month to cater to multiple stakeholders. Given that I have fairly standardised slide content, this makes presentations a high value automation target for myself.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve experimented with markdown presentation tools. However, I run into a lot of issues where I do not have full positional control of the objects.\nStakeholders tend to ask for extra features or to move shapes around the slide. However, this is happens to be the power of python-pptx library.\nPython-pptx is much more powerful in controling the powerpoint design in comparison to letting markdown dictate all the default positions of your powerpoint shapes.\nThe control of the objects is very granular its therefore very important to set up functions to standardise some layouts or shapes you want to insert. This speeds up the presentation building process as usually slides tend to borrow a lot of the same code.\nThe powerpoint functions I write are imported from a seperate .py file. A global function file helps us share the functions to any python script involving presentation automation.\nNote: Python-pptx works in similar fashion to xlsxwriter. Everytime the script is run, a brand new presentation file will be built from sratch.\nSmtplib - Email Automation with Python Routine emails sent on a recurring basis can be automated using the python library smtplib.\nWe can borrow the SMTP protocol to send our emails and we can avoid our GUI email environment entirely. Python acts as the interface and can send the email directly.\nThe script can be designed to have a message template built into itself. Additonally, we can make a list of tuples containing the addresses and attachments you want to send to the respective parties.\nBy looping over these templates and lists, we can entirely bypass the requirement of building all the components for all the emails.\nTens of emails can be sent out in a matter of seconds.\nConclusion Considering the tasks we do daily,weekly and monthly; we can tie our procedures together with an elaborate series of Python tools to save hundreds, if not thousands of hours.\nFor most organisations, the cost benefit ratio is extremely favourable if automation systems are applied (and maintained) correctly.\nThe value of your time increases exponentially as you are able to prioritise resources in creating higher quality work.\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/data_system/","tags":["python","sql","powerpoint","outlook","excel","automation","programming"],"title":"Building Data Pipelines With Python: Systems Perspective"},{"categories":["programming"],"contents":"Summary Documenting the most common ways I interact with git and in maintaining my programs. For reference these actions are performed via the command line.\nIn my opinion the main benefit of using a CLI is the added efficiency of the scripting out the majority of the process via usage of shell scripts.\nThis allows you to direct all of your attention on effortless creating work without getting lost in a GUI just to push a new commit.\nConnections and Authentication There are 2 main ways to connect to a git repository. We can either use the HTTPS or SSH protocols respectively.\nSSH has the advantage of having passwordless interactions with git which I strongly recommended when pushing code. Its very easy to set-up an SSH key-pair; it saves time and its very secure. (Assuming you take the right precautions to protect your ssh-keys!)\nI would only use HTTPS if I am cloning someone-elses public repository but not for maintaining my personal repos'.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t discuss the methods of generating access tokens which can be used to authenticate an https connection. In my experience this is the inferior way to authenticate your connection unless you have some sort of specific reasons to use https with an access token.\nCreate Local Repo and Connect to Remote Repository Go to Github and create a new repository Go to the working directory of your machine and initialise the local repo by typing: git init Connect local repo to remote repo by typing: git remote set-url origin repo_ssh_address Cloning a Github Repo Go to Github and copy ssh address of repository Go to the directory where you want to clone the repository into and type: git clone repo_ssh_address Or if you don\u0026rsquo;t have an ssh key-pair set-up ,you can just switch the address with the HTTPS version which works just the same: git clone repo_https_address Creating SSH Keys for Authentication Protocol Go to your dot ssh directory which is storing ssh-keys Type this command to generate an SSH Keypair: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C youremail@yourdomain.com Name your SSH keys, and skip password prompts Copy the public key of the two that were generated and paste into the Github settings where you are saving your public keys Initialise SSH-Agent and Add Private SSH Key To Key Chain This only lasts as long as your terminal instance is open. If you close the terminal, you need to re-type the commands to restart the ssh-agent for the next terminal you spawn.\nNote: The ssh agent process only linked to the terminal you typed it in. So you will need to initialise the ssh-agent for every terminal instance you spawn (if you working on multiple terminals).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve already saved this as an shell script to save the effort of writing these commands all the time.\nTo start ssh-agent type: eval `ssh-agent` To add the private key to the ssh agent type: ssh-add path/to/your/private/ssh/key Commit Changes to Github Repository Pull the most recent version from the repo by typing: git pull origin main Make ammendments to your work and save it locally To queue up ALL changes to upload, type: git add .

However the developers are not providing personal API keys for this particular game.\nThere are some websites which are publishing the Valorant data into the public domain. I decided to scrape my own match data which is being hosted on their web clients.\nThough the volume of data highlighted on the website is limited compared to the actual volume of games I\u0026rsquo;ve played. I was only able to pull 30 matches worth of data.\nHowever, it was worth learning about the overall web-scraping process and adding more capabilities to my toolkit.\nLink to the project here: Valorant Web Scrapping Project\nScrapy - Web Scraper I used a python library called scrapy as my web-crawling tool and the website being interrogated was https://dak.gg/valorant/en/profile/FilPill-EUW\nInitialising Scrapy Project The command below creates all the starting files for building the web-crawler:\nscrapy startproject val_scraper Checking for 200 Response on Target Website I initialised a scrapy shell with the command:\nscrapy shell Inside the shell, I make a request to the website to check that my scraper has permissions to scrape the website.\nfetch (\u0026#39;https://dak.gg/valorant/en/profile/FilPill-EUW](https://dak.gg/valorant/en/profile/FilPill-EUW)a\u0026#39;) A successful connection will return a 200 response, otherwise any 4xx reponse code will inidicate an error or a lack of permissions to perform this specific operation.\nIdentifying Target For Scraping My initial approach involved attempting to parse out the HTML classes within the div\u0026rsquo;s however it did not work successfully. Despite the data being kept inside the HTML tags,I could not access them with my scraper.\nWhen I simulated the webscraper opening the website, it did not return any data at all. Just an empty HTML page with no data. Soonafter, I realised that javascript is being employed to dynamically load the data into the front-end.\nRealising this occurrence, I changed my approach. On the inspect elements page, I naviagted to the XHR/Fetch network tab to view what kind of requests were being made to the website, I found an https request which returns my match data in JSON format.\nThe spider script shown below is what is being ustilised to scrape the match data from the page:\nimport scrapy import json class PlayerState(scrapy.Spider): name = \u0026#39;playerState\u0026#39; start_urls = [\u0026#39;https://dak.gg/valorant/en/profile/FilPill-EUW\u0026#39;] headers = { \u0026#34;accept\u0026#34;:\u0026#34; application/json, text/plain, */*\u0026#34; } def parse(self, response): url = \u0026#39;https://val.dakgg.io/api/v1/accounts/JPnyLxsiavseiYbL8xtmWSuFRHdupX43u_hVynD5YScr2_Y32Wt2v5K-NvxvfDRWTL67AHdVSmoLTg/matches\u0026#39; request = scrapy.Request(url, callback = self.parse_api, headers=self.headers) yield request def parse_api(self,response): raw_data = response.body data = json.loads(raw_data) yield { \u0026#39;matches\u0026#39;:data[\u0026#39;matches\u0026#39;] } Running the spider To run the spider you run the following command:\nscrapy crawl playerState -O playerState.json The playerState argument in the command is referring to the class defined in my spider.\nThe results are saved in a json file of my choosing.\nData Analysis Since we are only pulling out 30 matches, we are fairly limited in generating valuable data visualisations.\nHowever the goal was mainly to gain an understanding of the overall webscraping process.\nThese are some of the visualisations made using python:\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/page_archive/val_scrp/","tags":["scrapy","json","webscraping","programming"],"title":"Valorant API - Web Scraping Project"},{"categories":["design"],"contents":"Summary I wanted to showcase my projects without devoting a large amount of time to maintaining HTML code and needed a framework to make it easy to share my projects.\nHugo is a static site generator written in Go and compiles your documents written in markdown into cleanly formatted HTML and CSS files.\nThe first iteration of my website was manually written in HTML/CSS. It was a little bit ugly compared to the second iteration which is using hugo framework. Additionally, using someone else\u0026rsquo;s theme takes alot of the legwork out of the page design.\nThe compiled HTML files are hosted on my github pages for reference.\nLink to the Hugo Markdown Files\nLink to Static HTML Hotsted on Github Pages\nProcess Here is some general guidance as to how this website was developed from a Linux OS perspective. The guidance should be adapted according to the OS being used:\nGithub Repositories To build and deploy the website, we require two seperate repositories:\nA production repo blog-web: with markup documents and web config. A deployment repo Filpill.github.io: with compiled static HTML files. Content is added to the markdown documents in the production repo. This is later compiled into static HTML.\nThe static files reside in the public folder. They are eventually pushed into the deployment repo.\nThe deployment repository exists so we can allow github to display the HTML files.\nInstalling Hugo on Arch Linux I\u0026rsquo;m working from an Arch based Linux OS at the time of development. Installing the hugo on arch can be done with the following pacman command: sudo pacman -S hugo Installing Hugo on Windows Update 17/02/23: I\u0026rsquo;ve added instructions for a Windows Installation for convinience. (I spend too much time switching between operating systems for certain tasks.)\nThere are two pre-requisites for setting up hugo - you must install:\nGit Bash GoLang We must make a set of directories in which we can install hugo:\ncd ~/ mkdir go cd go mkdir bin mkdir pkg mkdir src cd src mkdir github.com cd github.com mkdir gohugoio At this point we are able to clone the hugo repository and perform the install:\ncd gohugoio git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git cd hugo go install You can confirm hugo\u0026rsquo;s been installed by checking this path:\n$GOPATH/bin/hugo Creating New Website Initialise Website Folders To initialise a new website type the following command into your shell: hugo new site name_of_your_website This will create all the folder templates you need to get started. Website Theme There are a couple of approaches to this, you can either design your own theme or you can choose one that is publicly shared. I chose to use a repository containing a theme called PaperMod which is a minimalistic theme which fits my requirements. cd into your themes directory and clone the repository at that location. I\u0026rsquo;m choosing to use the SSH method to clone into it, however you can also use HTTPS method if you prefer: git clone git@github.com:adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git Configuration File The configuration document is in the root directory and is called config.toml This file configures various aspects of your website. How to make a webpage Hugo\u0026rsquo;s webpages reside in the content folder of your website.\ncd to the root of your website To make a new page type: (replace the page_folder and page_name with names of your choice) hugo new page_folder/page_name.md The name of the page and directory automatically form links for your website A new markdown file with a default template will appear for your page. Using markdown, you can populate the file with your webpage content. Images Images are stored in one of two directories. Either the static or assets folder:\nThe static folder exists if you wish to directly use your image in their original state via markdown. You may wish to optimise the image by scaling down the resolution or compressing the image, and this will only be the case if you call the image in the assets folder. You can make some HTML shortcodes to standardise the optimisation you want to apply to the image. Technically .gif files are not optimal inclusions into minimal websites due to the large file size. Although I like the visual presentation they provide. Compiling on Local Server Observing the compiled version of the (draft) website is simple, type the following command:\nhugo server -D Adding the -D argument at the end also compiles the documents with the draft status set to true. Omitting the -D at the end of the command will not render documents in draft state. The local website host is at this address: http://localhost:1313/ Adding a Submodule A git submodule is a record within that points to a specific commit in another directory.\nThis is a key component of this workflow as we want to send the contents of our public folder and point it to an external repo where we are hosting.\nIn our case want our deployment repo Filpill.github.io to be a submodule of the projects repo.\nTherefore we want to cd into the root folder of our projects website (blog-web) and type:\ngit submodule add -b main git@github.com:Filpill/Filpill.github.io.git public And this enables us build from blog-web and to push code from the public folder of blog-web straight to Filpill.github.io\nCompiling Static Files into Public Folder In order to compile the files nessesary for the deployment repository on git. Type the following command in the root directory of website:\nhugo -t hugo-PaperMod -D The argument after \u0026ldquo;-t\u0026rdquo; is theme which is being used to compile the website together. In my case I\u0026rsquo;m using hugo-PaperMod. The resulting files will compile straight into the public folder. Again similarly to the local host, adding a \u0026ldquo;-D\u0026rdquo; will transform draft pages as well as the finalised pages. You can choose to omit the \u0026ldquo;-D\u0026rdquo; when you are finalising the website. But you must change the draft state in the markdown pages. Deploying pages onto your Github Since all the static files are compiled in public and we have that folder pointing towards the deployment repo. We can just write our git commands to push the changes into deployment.\ncd public/ git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;deploying compiled html\u0026#34; git push origin main At this stage we have website up and running and hosted on github. Adding new content to the website is easily achieved with new markdown files. And changes are pushed with the previous 2 steps. Or we could script this out completely with a shell script.\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/hugo/","tags":["html","css","markdown","go","website","javascript","shell","vim","scripting"],"title":"Website Design with Hugo Framework"},{"categories":null,"contents":"About Me Aeronautical engineering educational background: Aero/Mechanical + Aircraft Design Self-taught data analytics programmer: Python/Microsoft SQL Server/GCP Biq Query Highly knowledgeable in airline safety management domain Interested in automation of data analytics Hobbyist 3D Print Designer Hobbyist Glider Pilot Resume Previous Next \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; / [pdf] View the PDF file here.

The design requirements were driven out from the 2017 BMFA competition (Payload Challenge). The design had to be capable of flying some circuits with varying volumes of water weighing up to 3.5kg. As project engineer, I was responsible for coordinating the technical requirements and outputs between our sub-teams. Previous Next \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; / [pdf] View the PDF file here. Aircraft Design Process The aircraft design process used in this project is an adaptation of the design process learnt in university for commercial passenger aircraft design. The design tools and flight mechanic equations developed previously have been repurposed such to fit the requirements for a UAV application.\nTo narrow the focus of our design point, data is collected on other aircraft configurations focused around payload missions. This data collection and market analysis process is a critical element to estimating the conceptual aircraft size and Maximum Take-off Weight (MTOW).\nThe design feasibility relies on estimating a relatively sensible MTOW. It is expected that early MTOW estimates may vary ±20% from the final result, however it is sufficient as a starting point.\nThe entire design process is cyclic and interdependant on other design elements, for example: adjustments in aerodynamic configuration may require a re-assessment of the centre of gravity positioning. There are hundreds of other situtations were systems are interconnected and require engineering attention.\nBeyond the conceptual design, we are relying on emulating design practices within the aircraft model building community in order to achieve a mechnical design that does not add any unecessary weight.\nWe have elected to stick with a highly conventional configuration which has been tried and tested. The materials involved are mixture between balsawood, plywood and carbon fibre. This list of materials provide a good stength to weight ratio for the mission we are designing for.\nAreas of the aircaft which experience high loading (e.g. landing gear, wing root etc.) have been reinforced with plywood and less stressed areas are built with the less dense materials such as balsa to maintain a low overall empty weight.\nConceptual Design Phase Detailed Design Phase Aircraft Market Analysis Aircraft CAD Concept Design Derive Flight Equations Preliminary CAD Design Select Appropriate Design Point Solidworks Final CAD Estimate MTOW and OWE Early Prototyping and Testing Decide on Aircraft Configuration Design Revisions and Improvement Aircraft Centre of Gravity Estimation Final Manufacturing Output Aerofoil Comparision and Selection Electronic Systems Integration Flight Dynamics Analysis Systems Validation and Testing Material Selection Wind Tunnel Testing Preliminary Structural Analysis Flight Test Solidworks Design Exploded View Standard water bottle storing main payload in fuselage.

Image Post-Processing Images need some further preparation to enable reliable PIV results. Usually this involves enhancing contrast of the images to make the particles visible. Additionally any background noise picked up by the camera needs to be subtracted from the image as we want to isolate the airflow as much as possible.
