It features a 7 inch touch display and a web camera plugged into the boards DSI (Display Serial Interface) connectors. Should the design become more compact in the future, the ribbon cables are ideal for routing inside tight enclosures.\nThe only necessary wired connection is a USB-C to provide power to the board. I\u0026rsquo;ve got my keyboard and mouse connected wirelessly via bluetooth to maintain control of the Raspberry Pi. This avoids having to constantly plug devices in and out between the Pi and my main PC.\nIn order to regulate the temperature of the Pi, I\u0026rsquo;ve mounted a 3V fan onto the PCB to cool the Pi\u0026rsquo;s CPU and memory chips. This is to maintain the peak performance of the chips in question.\nThe open back design also enables easy access to the GPIO headers should you need to plug in and program your electronics.

The remote desktop acess is requied for situations using the graphical desktop environment.\nIP Address Something thats common to both processes is that they both require the IP Address of the device.\nTo get the IP address, you can type this command into the Raspberry Pi terminal:\nhostname -I # or ping raspberrypi.local # or ifconfig Secure Shell (SSH) Remote Access For the SSH Remote Acess, I will be connecting to my Raspberry Pi via my Arch Linux VM which is running a zsh terminal. But you can follow this process on any shell, it will be exactly the same.\nPre-requisites Set up wireless networking capability onto the boot disc. Obtain Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s IP Address Create hostname for IP in the /etc/hosts file Setting Up Networking Assuming you are running a minimal distribution such as Raspberry Pi Lite OS, you will need a way to get access to the internet.\nGet the SD from the Pi which has the image installed onto it, and read it from your main PC.\nThe following steps will be performed in git bash, but you can also do this in your file explorer:\nNavigate to the boot device volume and create an ssh file:\ntouch ssh In the same directory (boot), we need to make a wpa_supplicant.conf file. This will provide the configuration to enable you to connect your wireless network setup.\nvim wpa_supplicant.conf Then enter the following into the configuration, and substitute the placeholders with your own network SSID and password to access the Wi-Fi.\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev update_config=1 country=\u0026lt;Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here\u0026gt; network={ ssid=\u0026#34;WIFI-NAME\u0026#34; psk=\u0026#34;WIFI-PASSWORD\u0026#34; } You can safely remove the SD card from your PC.\nPut the SD Card back into the Pi and power it on.\nSSH Into Raspberry Pi Via Terminal From the terminal of the machine you are trying to attempt the remote access, you can SSH using this command:\nssh \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;IP_ADDRESS\u0026gt; If you didn\u0026rsquo;t configure your pi user crentials, for reference these are the defaults:\nusername: pi password: raspberry So the SSH command may look like this for example:\nssh pi@192.---.-.--- You would then be prompted with a password for which you will have to enter in order to gain access.\nBut for security purposes I recommend you make your own username and password, then substitute with your own credentials.\nThe userame on the Raspberry Pi is filpill, so it would be modified like this:\nssh filpill@192.---.-.--- Replacing IP Address with Hostname Now obviously its not that easy to remember an IP address everytime you want to SSH into the Pi. So we could store an alias for the IP in the /etc/hosts directory.\nsudo vim /etc/hosts You\u0026rsquo;ll want to add a line in this file with the IP Address and hostname of the Raspberry Pi. The line you will add will look similar to this:\n192.---.-.--- raspberrypi So the next time you want to SSH into the Pi, instead of writing the full IP address, you can just write this:\nssh filpill@raspberrypi The command functions all the same in additon to being much easier to remember into the future.\nSSH Keys - Passwordless Access In order to increase the security of the SSH protocol, its recommended to create a set of SSH keys.\nYou can simply create a key-pair in your shell with this command:\nssh-keygen Then you will want to get the public key onto the raspberry pi to enable the key pair interaction. And it\u0026rsquo;s similar to SSH\u0026rsquo;ing into your device.\nssh-copy-id filpill@raspberrypi This will copy the public key into your pi, so the next time you try to SSH into the Pi, it will automatically unlock using the private key on your computer.\nRemote Desktop Access via Windows For demonstation purposes I will be using the Windows 10 Remote Desktop Connection application to provide my access. The same concepts can be applied to alternative software.\nPre-requisites There are a few of pre-requisite tasks to complete before attempting remote access:\nInstall a Graphical OS environment for the Pi Obtain the Pi\u0026rsquo;s IP Address Install xrdp on the Raspberry Pi Add a secondary user to the Raspberry Pi with Sudo privillages Enable Remote Desktop Access in the raspi-config Install xrdp To install xrdp, type this command into the Raspberry Pi terminal:\nsudo apt-get install xrdp Then you need to start the xrdp service like this:\nsudo systemctl start xrdp New/Secondary User To add a new user, type this command:\nsudo adduser \u0026lt;INSERT USERNAME\u0026gt; Skip all the prompts to fill in user detaiils with the Enter Key.\nThen to give the user sudo privileges i.e. adding them to the sudo group:\nsudo adduser \u0026lt;INSERT USERNAME\u0026gt; sudo Enable Remote Desktop Access To enable this access, you need to enter the command:\nsudo raspi-config You need to navigate it the interface options; you need to enable the graphical remote access on the VNC option.\nThen finish the config to apply the settings and reset the Raspberry Pi.\nWindows - Remote Desktop Connection Application Now you can switch back to the Windows PC environment.\nOpen the Remote Desktop Connection App.\nEnter the IP Address you noted earlier from the Raspberry Pi and proceed to connect.\nYou should find yourself inside a login screen for xdrp.\nFor the user credentials, you should use the username and password you created on the Raspberry Pi as the secondary user.\nYou should now have graphical access to your Raspberry Pi via your Windows Machine.\nNote: This RDP procedure only works in a graphical OS, this does not apply to minimalist operating systems without a graphical UI because the display server will have nothing to render.\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/pi_ssh/","tags":["cli","shell","raspberry pi","linux","ssh"],"title":"Raspberry Pi Remote Access Guide"},{"categories":["engineering","design"],"contents":"Summary This project has been made to practise the use of sending instructions to various electronics via serial communications.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve segmented this project into two parts/versions:\nArduino - Manual Control with Mouse via Serial Comms Port Raspberry Pi - AI Face Tracking with Python and Camera Module Arduino The arduino project is very simple, there is a program written in Processing which takes the mouse inputs send strings (enclosed in \u0026lt;\u0026gt;) to the Arduino via serial communications.\nA small delay of 100ms is maintained to limit the rate of data coming to the Arduino board.

Thats the consequence of a lack of planning and design contraints\u0026hellip;\nThe reason for the large wheels in the back is because of how I started my design process. The design was built around the gearbox. Since the gearbox ended up being very tall, I figured I would just mount some very large wheels to clear the ground. Therefore I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to think about mounting points for the rear wheel, nor a CV jointed drive shaft. It was simply direct drive and it was all 3D printed (except the steering mechanism).\nAfter doing some testing on the rear drive-shaft, it was soon discovered to be necessary to bw printed sideways. This is to take advantage of the directional strength of the 3D printed layers so they can tolerate a degree of torque. I made them mistake of printing the shafts vertically, however this drive-train produces incredible amounts of torque such that the plastic drive shaft failed in 10 seconds of run time. Layer adhesion alone is definitely not strong enough to withstand a large torgue being applied to a small cross-section.\nI wanted to make my design as simple as reasonably possible. In my previous projects, trying to implement a suspension was fairly complicated and I had limited spare time I had outside of my 9-5. My only goal was to get a suitable functional prototype car.\nI did end up using the lessons from my previous failed car designs to incorporate into this one. I had a 2 year hiatus from designing anything mechanical, so I suprised even myself when I managed to build out a working 3D printed gearbox.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not perfect by any stretch of the imagination; after the assembly I still had to take a dremel to various parts to shave off some millimeters in order to free up mechanisms and part fits. Even after checking for collisions in Solidworks, the clearances and fits may not be what you expect in real life.\nIf I design more cars in the future, I will try make more thoughtful and elegant designs with improved tolerancing. Even after 4 years of 3D printing, its not straightforward to nail down the tolerancing. To be honest, I think it is extremely reliant on trial an error to nail down correctly, but at least its at the point of acceptability for this design.\nGeneral Car Stats Dimensions: Approx. 300mm x 230mm Weight: Approx 1.2kg (including electronics) Motor: 550/35T Battery: 11.1V 3S LiPo Servo: MG995-R Plastic Used: PLA Design Photos Here are some renders made in Solidworks:\nFront View Side View Top View Rear View Front Wheel Hub - Close Up Gearbox - Close Up Steering Articulation Gifs ","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/eng_projects/rctractor/","tags":["design","engineering","mechanical","3d-printing"],"title":"3D Printed RC Road Vehicle"},{"categories":["engineering"],"contents":"Summary This article will briefly outline the basic arrangement that can be used as guidance for your DIY RC electronics.\nParts List Any of these specific parts that are mentioned here can be interchanged for your specific needs.

However, you always have the option of hooking up and adapter.\nIn my case, I had to use as Deans (male) to Traxxas (female) adapter to complete the circuit.\nBlock Diagram - Connections Here is the component block diagram:\nmindmap root((ESC)) Motor BEC Reciever Servo Battery Voltage Indicator The ESC as the hub of the system in which everything connects to. The ESC on my system also happens peform the functionalilty of the BEC and can be considered as one unit.\nRadio My radio Rx/Tx system came as a package, and were already \u0026ldquo;bound\u0026rdquo; together already. As long as I could supply a current to the reciever, it automatically connect to the transmitter.\nIf you do not have binding (or need to use a new reciever), there are usually specific procedures to follow for your given controller to bind them together (in the manual for the controller).\nThere are no complicated procedures outside of this, you just need to follow the block diagram and make sure the components are rated for the supplied voltage/current.\nThe radio transmitter I used has 6 channels.\nFor reference my servo was plugged into Channel 1 (CH1), my ESC/Motor was plugged into Channel 2 (CH2).\nThere are still 4 empty channels open for other electronics such as additional servos can supplement your RC controls.\nLiPo Battery Maintenance Safety Precautions should be taken when using LiPo batteries, they can be very dangerous if mishandled.\nStorage If you are not using the LiPo\u0026rsquo;s when they are in a \u0026ldquo;charged\u0026rdquo; state, then you should consider discharging them to a \u0026ldquo;storage voltage\u0026rdquo;. A safe storage voltage per cell is somewhere between 3.6V and 3.8V.\nCharging The maximum allowable voltage of a LiPo cell is 4.2V per cell. Do not overcharge the battery as you may cause damage to the battery and reduce the lifespan; it may also become a fire hazard if consitently overcharged.\nIn terms of charging rates, I am charging my batteries at a rate of 1C. For a 2200mAH battery this equates to 2.2A.\nDischarging The inverse is true about discharging the battery too much. Do not let the LiPo voltage fall below 3.2V per cell as this will also cause internal damage to the battery which is irreversible. To mitigate this risk, you can use a voltage alarm on your circuit to warn you when the voltage is falling below a desired threshold.\nSigns to Discontinue Battery Usage A well maintenaed LiPo battery should be able to safely achieve at least 300 full charge/discharge cycles if obeying the precautions above.\nThere are a list of signals decide whether or not to discontinue use of any given LiPo:\nIf you see ballooning occur in the battery. Battery not holding a charge and voltage drop-off. Battery getting warm when charging at a rate of 1C. Physical dents or damage to the battery increasing the internal resistance.

Network configuration is not in the scope of this guide if you are installing on bare metal.\nThe motivation behind this web page is to keep some guidance material for myself and also for anybody new looking to install Arch from scratch.\nThe virtual machine is made with Microsofts Hyper-V program. The steps may differ slightly if you choose to use a another hypervisor such as VirtualBox.\nArch Linux ISO Download Link You can find the download link to the Arch Linux ISO here: https://archlinux.org/download/\nThe recommended way to pull down the ISO file is by torrenting it from the referenced magnet link.\nWhen the download is complete, you can configure your virtual machine.\nCreating a Virtual Machine The first step is to open up Hyper-V and create a new virtual machine You will be asked which generation of VM to create. I would reccommend to select \u0026ldquo;Generation 2\u0026rdquo;. It supports UEFI firmware and it should be better from a cyber-security standpoint. You can specify how much memory to allocate to the VM. I decided to allocate 4000MB in my use case. Hyper-V has a built in network adapter that works out of the box, so you\u0026rsquo;d want to select \u0026ldquo;Default Switch\u0026rdquo; to have it enabled. For the VM you should create a virtual hard disk to store the data. I decided to allocate 30GB of storage space. You need to select the arch linux ISO file to boot from and then you can finalise the VM creation. We are not done yet, we still need to configure 2 more things in the settings panel of this VM we just created. We need to disable Secure Boot, if you do not do this step, it will interfere with your ability to boot the ISO image. Next we need to bump the Hard Drive to the first priority of boot loading. Its very important that you do this step before you start installing linux otherwise the Grub will fail down the line because it will be trying to boot from the DVD Drive. You will not be able to retroactively change the boot order at a later stage. After applying the changes:\nConnect to the VM Start the VM Booting From Arch Linux ISO Image From this screen select the highlighted option to load the ISO image The install process starts here: Before going any further, you should test that your internet connecting works. You can use the ping command to run the test to any website:\nping archlinux.org Hyper-V should be providing your VM with the internet connection in anycase. If not, you will probably need to configure Hyper-V to alleviate networking issues. We also need to synchronise the systems clock with the network time, this command will enable that for you. Drive Partitioning and Filesystems Now we need to start partitioning our drives and creating our filesystem.\nIf you type \u0026ldquo;lsblk\u0026rdquo; you can see which drives and partitions are on your system. We want to \u0026ldquo;cfdisk\u0026rdquo; into \u0026ldquo;/dev/sda\u0026rdquo; which effectively our hard disk. At this juncture we need to assign the disk label type and it comes down to two options mainly:\nIf your hardware is new and your hard drive is over 2TB, then the recommendation is to use gpt. If you don\u0026rsquo;t fulfill the above conditions, then the recommendation is use dos. In our case we are using dos. There are many partition schemes to choose from, but I will keep it simple and only include the boot patition and root parititon:\n/dev/sda1 (boot partition) only needs about 128MB of space and needs to be bootable. You can press b to enable the boot flag after making the parition. /dev/sda2 (root paritition) can be assigned the remaining space of the disk. Write the changes and quit out of cfdisk. If you lsblk now, you will now see that 2 paritions have been made, sda1 and sda2. You will need to make a directory with this path: /mnt/boot/efi which can be done with the mkdir command. We are creating a mount point for the boot partition. Normally you don\u0026rsquo;t need the efi folder, but its necesarry here since we have a UEFI system config.\nWe also need to make the file systems for each parition sda1 is FAT filesystem and root is ext4.\nRun these commands:\nmkfs.fat -F /dev/sda1 mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 Now the mounting procedure MUST go in a specific order:\nsda2 (root) is mounted first to /mnt sda1 (boot) is mounted second to /mnt/boot/efi mount /dev/sda2 /mnt mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi I can\u0026rsquo;t explain the reasoning, but if you do it in reverse, the install will fail down the line. You will have to ignore the order of the commands in image as I remounted in the afforementioned order later. At this point you are ready install the base tools for the system as well as the linux kernel.\nUse the pacstrap command to install the following tools to /mnt Next you want to generate your fstab configuration. Run the following command: Chrooting into Arch Install At this stage we chroot into our installation filesystem/environment by running this command: Pacman is our package manager and we can use it to install \u0026ldquo;networkmanager\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;grub\u0026rdquo; as follows.\nNetwork manager is a program for managing our internet capabilities and grub is our boot loader. We can use systemctl to enable network manager as a service which starts automatically when you boot the computer (which is very useful to have). We also need to install \u0026ldquo;efibootmgr\u0026rdquo; as this is a dependancy for grubs installation. Next we run the grub-install command on /dev/sda\nIt should run with no errors. We need to make a config file for grub, which is done using the following command:\ngrub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg We need to vim into this grub file and make an edit to it. We need to uncomment the line \u0026ldquo;GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false\u0026rdquo; and then save the file. Run the passwd command to set a root password for the machine Then we want to vim into /etc/locale.gen to change the language settings of the machine. Uncomment the lines that apply to your language of choice. Run \u0026ldquo;local-gen\u0026rdquo; command to generate the locales you have selected. Vim into a new file called /etc/locale.conf and set the language being used. Type in the language. Vim into /etc/hostname The word you type in here will be the name of your computer. Type the below command to set up the local time zone of your system. Greenwich can be substituted for any region within that zoneinfo folder. Rebooting the System At this stage we should be ready to reboot the system. We need to exit out of the root environment. Then we need to unmount all the partitions and reboot the system.\nType all the commands as follows: If successful you should be greeted with this screen. You can select \u0026ldquo;Arch Linux\u0026rdquo; to boot into the system. And you should see a tty apper on your screen. Since we do not have any users set up on the system, we can only login as root for the time being. So you can just enter the root credentials. That\u0026rsquo;s about it, you now have a base install of Arch Linux. From this point you are free to customise your desktop to your liking.\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/arch_install/","tags":["Linux"],"title":"Arch Linux Installation Guide"},{"categories":["data"],"contents":"Summary I\u0026rsquo;ve played a decent number of chess games on the chess.com platform since 2019 and all my chess data can be explored using the API endpoints documented inside the website.\nI was interested in monitoring my rating change over the cumalative number of games played.\nLink to the project here: Chess.com - Python Analysis\nAnalytics Process Flow graph TD; subgraph Process Initiation 0([Python Notebook Executed])--\u003eA[HTTPS Request Chess Username Stats] end subgraph Data Extraction A--\u003eB[Requesting List of Month Endpoints] B--\u003eC[Request List Games For Each Month Endpoint] C--\u003eD[Unpack all Games into Dataframe] end subgraph Data Cleaning D--\u003eE[Filtering to Blitz Chess Games] E--\u003eF[Cleaning pgn Chess data\nand Merging Additional Attributes] F--\u003eG[Extracting Player Ratings\nand Game Results] G--\u003eH[Curating List of Columns] end subgraph Data Aggregation H--\u003eJ[Top Openings] H--\u003eK[Time of Day] H--\u003eL[Monthly Volume] H--\u003eM[Game Result] end subgraph Visualisation J--\u003eN[Graphing Openings] K--\u003eO[Graphing Time of Day] L--\u003eP[Graphing Monthly Volume] M--\u003eQ[Graphing Game Result] end subgraph XlsxDashboard N--\u003eR[Insert and Format Tabular Data] O--\u003eR P--\u003eR Q--\u003eR R--\u003eS[Insert Matplotlib Charts] S--\u003eT([Close Xlsxwriter Workbook Object]) end Data Visualisations The following images are served directly from my github repository:\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/chess/","tags":["python","data","programming","webscraping"],"title":"Chess.com API - Data Visualisation"},{"categories":["programming"],"contents":"Summary A game where you test your luck: Pick some numbers and try to win!\nLink to github project: https://github.com/Filpill/lottery-game\nLottery Algorithm flowchart TD; subgraph Lottery Algorithm start(Pick \\nLottery Numbers) --Check--\u003e check{Are the \\ninputs valid?} check --Yes--\u003e draw[Generate Randomised\\nLottery Draw] check --No--\u003e start draw --\u003e match{Do Picks Match the\\n Lottery Draw?} match --Yes--\u003e win(Winner!) match --No--\u003e reroll[Chance to reroll\\nthe incorrect numbers] reroll --\u003e check2{Did you hit any\\n more correct picks?} check2 --No--\u003e lost(Loser!) check2 --Yes--\u003e check3{Are they\\n all matching?} check3 --No--\u003e reroll check3 --Yes--\u003e win end ","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/page_archive/lottery/","tags":["python"],"title":"Python Lottery Game"},{"categories":[],"contents":"Summary I\u0026rsquo;ve made a Tableau Public profile to showcase any public datasets I\u0026rsquo;ve analysed in Tableau:\nLink to Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/filip.livancic\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/page_archive/tableau_public/","tags":[],"title":"Tableau Public Profile - Filip Livancic"},{"categories":["programming"],"contents":"Summary I\u0026rsquo;ve been very involved in practising my programming skills in python and sql lately on codewars.\nI figured it would be a good idea to visualise my codewars progression.\nI\u0026rsquo;m utilising the codewars public API to pull out my information.

The only drawback is that there is no way to pull out the individual charts from the dashboard view via this API. Therefore you need to specify all the pixel dimensions to crop the images into their respective charts.\nThe only alternative is to implement a web-scraping technique on Tableau Server and figure out a way to pull down the chart data. It would probably require something like Selenium because of the dynamic nature of the website.\nRegardless, with the Tableau Client Server API you will still benefit from the dashboard image extraction in addition to allowing you to repurpose your existing dashboards for presentation purposes.\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/tableauapi/","tags":["python","tableau","automation","programming"],"title":"Tableau Client Server API: Extracting Dashboard Images"},{"categories":["data","programming"],"contents":"Summary There are endless oppertunities to streamline processes and automate our data production tasks.\nThis article serves as an example for the wide ranging applications I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Python to automate both simple and complex tasks with high efficiency.\nData Pipelines These are some of the goals we are trying to achieve:\nTo build complete end-to-end data solutions from the data source to user. We want to minimise manual task interventions during the data processing. To build tools which are adaptable to the needs of the business. This is a high level view of a data analytics pipeline I\u0026rsquo;ve built in the past: graph TD; subgraph Process Initiation 0A([Data Analyst Initiates Process])--\u003eA 0A--\u003eB end subgraph Extract, Transform, and Analyse Data A[Shell Scripts]-- exec. via cli tools --\u003eC((Python Scripts)) B[Task Scheduler]-- auto exec. --\u003eC((Python Scripts)) D[(SQL Server)]-- data retrieval --\u003eC-- pyodbc --\u003eD C--\u003e E(Matplotlib charts) C--\u003e F(Pandas tables) E-- saved as .png --\u003e G(Saved In Network Drive) F-- saved as .csv --\u003eG subgraph Create Data Product G-- xlsxwriter --\u003eH(Excel\nDashboards) G-- python-pptx --\u003eI(Powerpoint\nPresentations) end end subgraph Process Termination H--\u003eJ(Emails sent via SMTP) I--\u003eJ J-- smtplib --\u003eK([End User Recieves Data Product]) end Note: Python scripts are chained together to connect the processes together and handle various tasks along the pipeline\nThis is the result of incremental upgrades made gradually over time to optimise my workflow. I\u0026rsquo;ve saved much time inter-weaving these python libraries together.\nAs long as the tools are well built, you can bridge them across to new processes easily and maintain them with minimal effort. Not to mention you will be saving hundreds (and maybe thousands of) hours as you execute these processes.\nThe idea is not to replicate this system one-to-one, but to demonstate the possibilities for connecting automation tools togther.\nAnd perhaps we can learn to make more elaborate systems\u0026hellip;\nPyODBC - A SQL Interface For Python The most important setup of the automation process is the ingestion of data into the Python environment.\nFortunately for myself, our organisation hosts several Microsoft SQL Servers which form part of our data warehouse.\nPyODBC is a python module which can authenticate and connect directly to your desired SQL server. The great thing about it is that you can wrap an entire query written in SQL with a triple quote string directly within your python script. The module will be able to send the query out using the relevant ODBC driver on your machine.\nThe pyodbc set-up can be generalised because you only need two inputs: the server name and the sql query. Therefore I have developed a python utility written which can be imported into any data processing script as a module.\nXlsxWriter - Excel Report Generator For Python The proliferation of Excel as a standard piece of software has enabled much easier sharing and communication of data. There is no office computer in the world that is not supplied with Excel.\nBI tools are also used to communicate and share data accross the business. However, this depends on how much the organisation can stretch the budget to license the majority of individuals.\nWorking inside the Excel ecosystem can help save on the extra overhead. However, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to be doing any analysis in Excel.\nWhy?\u0026hellip;\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s extremely computationally expensive to handle large data sets. And its next to useless when stringing together a series of complex formulas to analyse data.\nHow can we solve this issue? Simple \u0026ndash; Xlsxwriter.\nXlsxwriter is a python module which allows you to create fresh Excel reports from scratch with analysis conducted in Python. You can turn all your pandas dataframes into Excel tables. Additionally, matplotlib charts can be inserted into the workbook to act as the visualisation component.\nWith a bit of effort, you can easily turn the analysis into a dashboard that mimics the appearance of an Excel spreadsheet. I frequently use this tool to get dashboards into production quickly with python.\nNote: XlsxWriter as the name suggests \u0026ldquo;writes Excel Workbooks\u0026rdquo;. To be clear, this is not an API that can directly interact with objects of pre-existing workbooks. Everytime you execute a script with xlsxwriter tools involved, a completely new file will be produced and overwrite the previous version.\nPython-Pptx - PowerPoint Presentation Generator For Python How many hours do you waste making powerpoints? I\u0026rsquo;ve spent countless hours adjusting trivial features such as formatting or chart positioning.\nBut what if the presentation content and design can be prepared automatically?\nI generate tens of presentations per month to cater to multiple stakeholders. Given that I have fairly standardised slide content, this makes presentations a high value automation target for myself.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve experimented with markdown presentation tools. However, I run into a lot of issues where I do not have full positional control of the objects.\nStakeholders tend to ask for extra features or to move shapes around the slide. However, this is happens to be the power of python-pptx library.\nPython-pptx is much more powerful in controling the powerpoint design in comparison to letting markdown dictate all the default positions of your powerpoint shapes.\nThe control of the objects is very granular its therefore very important to set up functions to standardise some layouts or shapes you want to insert. This speeds up the presentation building process as usually slides tend to borrow a lot of the same code.\nThe powerpoint functions I write are imported from a seperate .py file. A global function file helps us share the functions to any python script involving presentation automation.\nNote: Python-pptx works in similar fashion to xlsxwriter. Everytime the script is run, a brand new presentation file will be built from sratch.\nSmtplib - Email Automation with Python Routine emails sent on a recurring basis can be automated using the python library smtplib.\nWe can borrow the SMTP protocol to send our emails and we can avoid our GUI email environment entirely. Python acts as the interface and can send the email directly.\nThe script can be designed to have a message template built into itself. Additonally, we can make a list of tuples containing the addresses and attachments you want to send to the respective parties.\nBy looping over these templates and lists, we can entirely bypass the requirement of building all the components for all the emails.\nTens of emails can be sent out in a matter of seconds.\nConclusion Considering the tasks we do daily,weekly and monthly; we can tie our procedures together with an elaborate series of Python tools to save hundreds, if not thousands of hours.\nFor most organisations, the cost benefit ratio is extremely favourable if automation systems are applied (and maintained) correctly.\nThe value of your time increases exponentially as you are able to prioritise resources in creating higher quality work.\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/data_system/","tags":["python","sql","powerpoint","outlook","excel","automation","programming"],"title":"Building Data Pipelines With Python: Systems Perspective"},{"categories":["programming"],"contents":"Summary This article documents the most common ways I interact with git and in maintaining my programs.\ngraph LR; subgraph High-Level Process direction LR 0[Installation]--\u003e1[SSH] 1 --\u003e 2[Git Configuration] 2 --\u003e 3[New Repository] 3 --\u003e 4[Commit Changes] end Why should I use Git with the Command Line? Git was designed as a command-line tool, therefore it\u0026rsquo;s considered the de-facto way to interact with Git\u0026rsquo;s tools.\nAny other versions of Git are just wrappers for what Git does on the command-line. GUI type Software built \u0026ldquo;around Git\u0026rdquo; has tendencies to introduce bugs which are difficult to resolve.\nYou are abstracted away from what Git is actually doing, so it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to tell if the error was with action performed in Git or if the software was somehow glitched.\nOther tools may also rebrand some git commands to other names which can present communication issues if people are using different flavours of Git.\nBut its worth building some knowledge around the concept of how to use the Shell. Bash (shell) scripting is worth its weight it gold if leveraged correctly. It\u0026rsquo;s great for task automation and shell is a transferable skill to other command-line type programs, e.g. bq command-line tool for GCP.\nConnections and Authentication There are 2 main ways to connect to a git repository. We can either use the HTTPS or SSH protocols respectively.\nSSH has the advantage of having passwordless interactions with git which I strongly recommended when pushing code. Its trivial to set-up an SSH key-pair; it saves time and its very secure. (Assuming you take the right precautions to protect your ssh-keys!)\nMy deep personal recommendation is to use the SSH Method and avoid using the access tokens for authentications.\nSomething worth noting is that Git will search the path for the ssh-key file ~/.ssh/id_rsa by default. Make you name your file id_rsa otherwise it will not work.\nCreating SSH Keys Using ssh-keygen Go to your ~/.ssh directory which is storing ssh-keys Type this command to generate an SSH Keypair: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C emailnae@domain.com Name your SSH keys (preferably \u0026ldquo;id_rsa\u0026rdquo; for the default filename), and skip password prompts \u0026ldquo;Cat\u0026rdquo; out the public key (suffixed .pub) that was generated and paste into the Github settings for SSH Keys For security purposes, permissions need to be changed for the keys, you can change them using the below command prevent external read/write access: chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Handling Multiple SSH Keys Using Keychain If you happen to decide to put your keys outside the default path (~/.ssh/id_rsa), git won\u0026rsquo;t search for them.\nI\u0026rsquo;m using a program called Keychain which can help manage your SSH Keys more easily. Its driving the underlying ssh-add and ssh-agent commands.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve added this line (shown below) to my .bashrc in order to add the relevant SSH key to the keychain.\nWhen I spawn a terminal, it will activate this command automatically and start a new process.\neval $(keychain --eval ~/.ssh_id_rsa/arch_vm) #2\u0026gt;/dev/null In order to do the same process manually, these are the following commands:\neval `ssh-agent` ssh-add path/to/your/private/ssh/key Git Basic Setup Setting Up Git Config Inside your home directory you should have a file called .gitconfig which should be empty on a fresh install.\nYou can define the username and email of your github account in here with the following commands:\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;github_user_name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;emailname@domain.com\u0026#34; Create Git Repository This is the overall process of creating a repo on the CLI: graph LR; subgraph Creating Git Repository 0[Create README with Repo Name]--\u003e2[Initialise Git] 2 --\u003e 3[Stage Changes] 3 --\u003e 4[Link Local Repo to Remote Repo] 4 --\u003e 5[Commit Changes] end Create a README and initialise git with these commands: echo \u0026#34;# repository_name\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; README.md git init By default the branch is called \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo;, however this can be renamed to anything you desire.\nLets rename \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; for example using this command:\ngit branch -m main Staging is the process of preparing the changed files for the next commit.\nYou can stage the files with add; the full stop will include all files that have changed.

However the developers are not providing personal API keys for this particular game.\nThere are some websites which are publishing the Valorant data into the public domain. I decided to scrape my own match data which is being hosted on their web clients.\nThough the volume of data highlighted on the website is limited compared to the actual volume of games I\u0026rsquo;ve played. I was only able to pull 30 matches worth of data.\nHowever, it was worth learning about the overall web-scraping process and adding more capabilities to my toolkit.\nLink to the project here: Valorant Web Scrapping Project\nScrapy - Web Scraper I used a python library called scrapy as my web-crawling tool and the website being interrogated was https://dak.gg/valorant/en/profile/FilPill-EUW\nInitialising Scrapy Project The command below creates all the starting files for building the web-crawler:\nscrapy startproject val_scraper Checking for 200 Response on Target Website I initialised a scrapy shell with the command:\nscrapy shell Inside the shell, I make a request to the website to check that my scraper has permissions to scrape the website.\nfetch (\u0026#39;https://dak.gg/valorant/en/profile/FilPill-EUW](https://dak.gg/valorant/en/profile/FilPill-EUW)a\u0026#39;) A successful connection will return a 200 response, otherwise any 4xx reponse code will inidicate an error or a lack of permissions to perform this specific operation.\nIdentifying Target For Scraping My initial approach involved attempting to parse out the HTML classes within the div\u0026rsquo;s however it did not work successfully. Despite the data being kept inside the HTML tags,I could not access them with my scraper.\nWhen I simulated the webscraper opening the website, it did not return any data at all. Just an empty HTML page with no data. Soonafter, I realised that javascript is being employed to dynamically load the data into the front-end.\nRealising this occurrence, I changed my approach. On the inspect elements page, I naviagted to the XHR/Fetch network tab to view what kind of requests were being made to the website, I found an https request which returns my match data in JSON format.\nThe spider script shown below is what is being ustilised to scrape the match data from the page:\nimport scrapy import json class PlayerState(scrapy.Spider): name = \u0026#39;playerState\u0026#39; start_urls = [\u0026#39;https://dak.gg/valorant/en/profile/FilPill-EUW\u0026#39;] headers = { \u0026#34;accept\u0026#34;:\u0026#34; application/json, text/plain, */*\u0026#34; } def parse(self, response): url = \u0026#39;https://val.dakgg.io/api/v1/accounts/JPnyLxsiavseiYbL8xtmWSuFRHdupX43u_hVynD5YScr2_Y32Wt2v5K-NvxvfDRWTL67AHdVSmoLTg/matches\u0026#39; request = scrapy.Request(url, callback = self.parse_api, headers=self.headers) yield request def parse_api(self,response): raw_data = response.body data = json.loads(raw_data) yield { \u0026#39;matches\u0026#39;:data[\u0026#39;matches\u0026#39;] } Running the spider To run the spider you run the following command:\nscrapy crawl playerState -O playerState.json The playerState argument in the command is referring to the class defined in my spider.\nThe results are saved in a json file of my choosing.\nData Analysis Since we are only pulling out 30 matches, we are fairly limited in generating valuable data visualisations.\nHowever the goal was mainly to gain an understanding of the overall webscraping process.\nThese are some of the visualisations made using python:\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/page_archive/val_scrp/","tags":["scrapy","json","webscraping","programming"],"title":"Valorant API - Web Scraping Project"},{"categories":["design"],"contents":"Summary I wanted to showcase my projects without devoting a large amount of time to maintaining HTML code and needed a framework to make it easy to share my projects.\nHugo is a static site generator written in Go and compiles your documents written in markdown into cleanly formatted HTML and CSS files.\nThe first iteration of my website was manually written in HTML/CSS. It was a little bit ugly compared to the second iteration which is using hugo framework. Additionally, using someone else\u0026rsquo;s theme takes alot of the legwork out of the page design.\nThe compiled HTML files are hosted on my github pages for reference.\nLink to the Hugo Markdown Files\nLink to Static HTML Hotsted on Github Pages\nProcess Here is some general guidance as to how this website was developed from a Linux OS perspective. The guidance should be adapted according to the OS being used:\nGithub Repositories To build and deploy the website, we require two seperate repositories:\nA production repo blog-web: with markup documents and web config. A deployment repo Filpill.github.io: with compiled static HTML files. Content is added to the markdown documents in the production repo. This is later compiled into static HTML.\nThe static files reside in the public folder. They are eventually pushed into the deployment repo.\nThe deployment repository exists so we can allow github to display the HTML files.\nInstalling Hugo on Arch Linux I\u0026rsquo;m working from an Arch based Linux OS at the time of development. Installing the hugo on arch can be done with the following pacman command: sudo pacman -S hugo Installing Hugo on Windows Update 17/02/23: I\u0026rsquo;ve added instructions for a Windows Installation for convinience. (I spend too much time switching between operating systems for certain tasks.)\nThere are two pre-requisites for setting up hugo - you must install:\nGit Bash GoLang We must make a set of directories in which we can install hugo:\ncd ~/ mkdir go cd go mkdir bin mkdir pkg mkdir src cd src mkdir github.com cd github.com mkdir gohugoio At this point we are able to clone the hugo repository and perform the install:\ncd gohugoio git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git cd hugo go install You can confirm hugo\u0026rsquo;s been installed by checking this path:\n$GOPATH/bin/hugo Creating New Website Initialise Website Folders To initialise a new website type the following command into your shell: hugo new site name_of_your_website This will create all the folder templates you need to get started. Website Theme There are a couple of approaches to this, you can either design your own theme or you can choose one that is publicly shared. I chose to use a repository containing a theme called PaperMod which is a minimalistic theme which fits my requirements. cd into your themes directory and clone the repository at that location. I\u0026rsquo;m choosing to use the SSH method to clone into it, however you can also use HTTPS method if you prefer: git clone git@github.com:adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git Configuration File The configuration document is in the root directory and is called config.toml This file configures various aspects of your website. How to make a webpage Hugo\u0026rsquo;s webpages reside in the content folder of your website.\ncd to the root of your website To make a new page type: (replace the page_folder and page_name with names of your choice) hugo new page_folder/page_name.md The name of the page and directory automatically form links for your website A new markdown file with a default template will appear for your page. Using markdown, you can populate the file with your webpage content. Images Images are stored in one of two directories. Either the static or assets folder:\nThe static folder exists if you wish to directly use your image in their original state via markdown. You may wish to optimise the image by scaling down the resolution or compressing the image, and this will only be the case if you call the image in the assets folder. You can make some HTML shortcodes to standardise the optimisation you want to apply to the image. Technically .gif files are not optimal inclusions into minimal websites due to the large file size. Although I like the visual presentation they provide. Compiling on Local Server Observing the compiled version of the (draft) website is simple, type the following command:\nhugo server -D Adding the -D argument at the end also compiles the documents with the draft status set to true. Omitting the -D at the end of the command will not render documents in draft state. The local website host is at this address: http://localhost:1313/ Adding a Submodule A git submodule is a record within that points to a specific commit in another directory.\nThis is a key component of this workflow as we want to send the contents of our public folder and point it to an external repo where we are hosting.\nIn our case want our deployment repo Filpill.github.io to be a submodule of the projects repo.\nTherefore we want to cd into the root folder of our projects website (blog-web) and type:\ngit submodule add -b main git@github.com:Filpill/Filpill.github.io.git public And this enables us build from blog-web and to push code from the public folder of blog-web straight to Filpill.github.io\nCompiling Static Files into Public Folder In order to compile the files nessesary for the deployment repository on git. Type the following command in the root directory of website:\nhugo -t hugo-PaperMod -D The argument after \u0026ldquo;-t\u0026rdquo; is theme which is being used to compile the website together. In my case I\u0026rsquo;m using hugo-PaperMod. The resulting files will compile straight into the public folder. Again similarly to the local host, adding a \u0026ldquo;-D\u0026rdquo; will transform draft pages as well as the finalised pages. You can choose to omit the \u0026ldquo;-D\u0026rdquo; when you are finalising the website. But you must change the draft state in the markdown pages. Deploying pages onto your Github Since all the static files are compiled in public and we have that folder pointing towards the deployment repo. We can just write our git commands to push the changes into deployment.\ncd public/ git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;deploying compiled html\u0026#34; git push origin main At this stage we have website up and running and hosted on github. Adding new content to the website is easily achieved with new markdown files. And changes are pushed with the previous 2 steps. Or we could script this out completely with a shell script.\n","permalink":"https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/hugo/","tags":["html","css","markdown","go","website","javascript","shell","vim","scripting"],"title":"Website Design with Hugo Framework"},{"categories":null,"contents":"About Me Aeronautical engineering educational background: Aero/Mechanical + Aircraft Design Self-taught data analytics programmer: Python/Microsoft SQL Server/GCP Biq Query Highly knowledgeable in airline safety management domain Interested in automation of data analytics Hobbyist 3D Print Designer Hobbyist Glider Pilot Resume Previous Next \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; / [pdf] View the PDF file here.

The design requirements were driven out from the 2017 BMFA competition (Payload Challenge). The design had to be capable of flying some circuits with varying volumes of water weighing up to 3.5kg. As project engineer, I was responsible for coordinating the technical requirements and outputs between our sub-teams. Previous Next \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; / [pdf] View the PDF file here. Aircraft Design Process The aircraft design process used in this project is an adaptation of the design process learnt in university for commercial passenger aircraft design. The design tools and flight mechanic equations developed previously have been repurposed such to fit the requirements for a UAV application.\nTo narrow the focus of our design point, data is collected on other aircraft configurations focused around payload missions. This data collection and market analysis process is a critical element to estimating the conceptual aircraft size and Maximum Take-off Weight (MTOW).\nThe design feasibility relies on estimating a relatively sensible MTOW. It is expected that early MTOW estimates may vary ±20% from the final result, however it is sufficient as a starting point.\nThe entire design process is cyclic and interdependant on other design elements, for example: adjustments in aerodynamic configuration may require a re-assessment of the centre of gravity positioning. There are hundreds of other situtations were systems are interconnected and require engineering attention.\nBeyond the conceptual design, we are relying on emulating design practices within the aircraft model building community in order to achieve a mechnical design that does not add any unecessary weight.\nWe have elected to stick with a highly conventional configuration which has been tried and tested. The materials involved are mixture between balsawood, plywood and carbon fibre. This list of materials provide a good stength to weight ratio for the mission we are designing for.\nAreas of the aircaft which experience high loading (e.g. landing gear, wing root etc.) have been reinforced with plywood and less stressed areas are built with the less dense materials such as balsa to maintain a low overall empty weight.\nConceptual Design Phase Detailed Design Phase Aircraft Market Analysis Aircraft CAD Concept Design Derive Flight Equations Preliminary CAD Design Select Appropriate Design Point Solidworks Final CAD Estimate MTOW and OWE Early Prototyping and Testing Decide on Aircraft Configuration Design Revisions and Improvement Aircraft Centre of Gravity Estimation Final Manufacturing Output Aerofoil Comparision and Selection Electronic Systems Integration Flight Dynamics Analysis Systems Validation and Testing Material Selection Wind Tunnel Testing Preliminary Structural Analysis Flight Test Solidworks Design Exploded View Standard water bottle storing main payload in fuselage.

In results shown below you will notice two distinct separation regions on the aerofoil. One at the bottom of the step due to the sudden adverse pressure gradient. And another at the top of the step as the flow is unable to sharply turn the corner.\nPrevious Next \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; / [pdf] View the PDF file here. Link to PIV Python Code For Results Post Processing\nExperimental Procedure Wind Tunnel Experiment The experimental procedure involves diffusing small oil droplets into the freestream flow and having a sheet of laser light illuminating a cross-section of the airflow. Hundreds of images are caputured in the process a high speed camera. Due to the limited field of vision, the results from the top and bottom of the step were recorded seperately. Image Post-Processing Images need some further preparation to enable reliable PIV results. Usually this involves enhancing contrast of the images to make the particles visible. Additionally any background noise picked up by the camera needs to be subtracted from the image as we want to isolate the airflow as much as possible. OpenPIV and Python Post-Process Scripts Particle displacements on the images can be determined by performing a cross-corrleation on the series of image pairs. In my case, I used OpenPIV software written in Python to extract all the velocity fields at all the times steps recorded. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;ve written some post-processing scripts for the velocity data text files in Python to animate experimental results.
