  "articleBody": "Summary There are endless opportunities to streamline processes and automate our data production tasks.\nThis article serves as an example for the wide ranging applications I‚Äôve been using Python to automate both simple and complex tasks with high efficiency.\nData Pipelines These are some of the goals we are trying to achieve:\nTo build complete end-to-end data solutions from the data source to user. We want to minimise manual task interventions during the data processing. To build tools which are adaptable to the needs of the business. This is a high level view of a data analytics pipeline I‚Äôve built in the past:\ngraph TD; subgraph Process Initiation 0A([Data Analyst Initiates Process])--\u003eA 0A--\u003eB end subgraph Data Pipelines A[Shell Scripts]-- exec. via cli tools --\u003eC((Python Scripts)) B[Task Scheduler]-- auto exec. --\u003eC((Python Scripts)) D[(SQL Server)]-- data retrieval --\u003eC C-- pyodbc --\u003eD C--\u003e E(Matplotlib charts) C--\u003e F(Pandas tables) E-- saved as .png --\u003e G(Saved In Network Drive) F-- saved as .csv --\u003eG subgraph Create Data Product G-- xlsxwriter --\u003eH(Excel\nDashboards) G-- python-pptx --\u003eI(Powerpoint\nPresentations) end end subgraph Process Termination H--\u003eJ(Emails sent via SMTP) I--\u003eJ J-- smtplib --\u003eK([End User Recieves Data Product]) end Note: Python scripts are chained together to connect the processes together and handle various tasks along the pipeline\nThis is the result of incremental upgrades made gradually over time to optimise my workflow. I‚Äôve saved much time inter-weaving these python libraries together.\nAs long as the tools are well built, you can bridge them across to new processes easily and maintain them with minimal effort. Not to mention you will be saving hundreds (and maybe thousands of) hours as you execute these processes.\nThe idea is not to replicate this system one-to-one, but to demonstrate the possibilities for connecting automation tools together.\nAnd perhaps we can learn to make more elaborate systems‚Ä¶\nPyODBC - A SQL Interface For Python The most important setup of the automation process is the ingestion of data into the Python environment.\nFortunately for myself, our organisation hosts several Microsoft SQL Servers which form part of our data warehouse.\nPyODBC is a python module which can authenticate and connect directly to your desired SQL server. The great thing about it is that you can wrap an entire query written in SQL with a triple quote string directly within your python script. The module will be able to send the query out using the relevant ODBC driver on your machine.\nThe pyodbc set-up can be generalised because you only need two inputs: the server name and the sql query. Therefore I have developed a python utility written which can be imported into any data processing script as a module.\nXlsxWriter - Excel Report Generator For Python The proliferation of Excel as a standard piece of software has enabled much easier sharing and communication of data. There is no office computer in the world that is not supplied with Excel.\nBI tools are also used to communicate and share data across the business. However, this depends on how much the organisation can stretch the budget to license the majority of individuals.\nWorking inside the Excel ecosystem can help save on the extra overhead. However, we don‚Äôt want to be doing any analysis in Excel.\nWhy?‚Ä¶\nBecause it‚Äôs extremely computationally expensive to handle large data sets. And its next to useless when stringing together a series of complex formulas to analyse data.\nHow can we solve this issue? Simple ‚Äì Xlsxwriter.\nXlsxwriter is a python module which allows you to create fresh Excel reports from scratch with analysis conducted in Python. You can turn all your pandas dataframes into Excel tables. Additionally, matplotlib charts can be inserted into the workbook to act as the visualisation component.\nWith a bit of effort, you can easily turn the analysis into a dashboard that mimics the appearance of an Excel spreadsheet. I frequently use this tool to get dashboards into production quickly with python.\nNote: XlsxWriter as the name suggests ‚Äúwrites Excel Workbooks‚Äù. To be clear, this is not an API that can directly interact with objects of pre-existing workbooks. Everytime you execute a script with xlsxwriter tools involved, a completely new file will be produced and overwrite the previous version.\nPython-Pptx - PowerPoint Presentation Generator For Python How many hours do you waste making PowerPoint‚Äôs? I‚Äôve spent countless hours adjusting trivial features such as formatting or chart positioning.\nBut what if the presentation content and design can be prepared automatically?\nI generate tens of presentations per month to cater to multiple stakeholders. Given that I have fairly standardised slide content, this makes presentations a high value automation target for myself.\nI‚Äôve experimented with markdown presentation tools. However, I run into a lot of issues where I do not have full positional control of the objects.\nStakeholders tend to ask for extra features or to move shapes around the slide. However, this is happens to be the power of python-pptx library.\nPython-pptx is much more powerful in controlling the PowerPoint design in comparison to letting markdown dictate all the default positions of your PowerPoint shapes.\nThe control of the objects is very granular its therefore very important to set up functions to standardise some layouts or shapes you want to insert. This speeds up the presentation building process as usually slides tend to borrow a lot of the same code.\nThe PowerPoint functions I write are imported from a separate .py file. A global function file helps us share the functions to any python script involving presentation automation.\nNote: Python-pptx works in similar fashion to xlsxwriter. Every time the script is run, a brand new presentation file will be built from scratch.\nSmtplib - Email Automation with Python Routine emails sent on a recurring basis can be automated using the python library smtplib.\nWe can borrow the SMTP protocol to send our emails and we can avoid our GUI email environment entirely. Python acts as the interface and can send the email directly.\nThe script can be designed to have a message template built into itself. Additionally, we can make a list of tuples containing the addresses and attachments you want to send to the respective parties.\nBy looping over these templates and lists, we can entirely bypass the requirement of building all the components for all the emails.\nTens of emails can be sent out in a matter of seconds.\nConclusion Considering the tasks we do daily,weekly and monthly; we can tie our procedures together with an elaborate series of Python tools to save hundreds, if not thousands of hours.\nFor most organisations, the cost benefit ratio is extremely favourable if automation systems are applied (and maintained) correctly.\nThe value of your time increases exponentially as you are able to prioritise resources in creating higher quality work.\n",

<p>How can we solve this issue? Simple &ndash; Xlsxwriter.</p>
<p>Xlsxwriter is a python module which allows you to create fresh Excel reports from scratch with analysis conducted in Python. You can turn all your pandas dataframes into Excel tables. Additionally, matplotlib charts can be inserted into the workbook to act as the visualisation component.</p>
<p>With a bit of effort, you can easily turn the analysis into a dashboard that mimics the appearance of an Excel spreadsheet. I frequently use this tool to get dashboards into production quickly with python.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> XlsxWriter as the name suggests &ldquo;writes Excel Workbooks&rdquo;. To be clear, this is not an API that can directly interact with objects of pre-existing workbooks. Everytime you execute a script with xlsxwriter tools involved, a completely new file will be produced and overwrite the previous version.</em></p>

<p>How many hours do you waste making PowerPoint&rsquo;s? I&rsquo;ve spent countless hours adjusting trivial features such as formatting or chart positioning.</p>
<p><em>But what if the presentation content and design can be prepared automatically?</em></p>
<p>I generate tens of presentations per month to cater to multiple stakeholders. Given that I have fairly standardised slide content, this makes presentations a high value automation target for myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experimented with markdown presentation tools. However, I run into a lot of issues where I do not have full positional control of the objects.</p>
<p>Stakeholders tend to ask for extra features or to move shapes around the slide. However, this is happens to be the power of python-pptx library.</p>
<p>Python-pptx is much more powerful in controlling the PowerPoint design in comparison to letting markdown dictate all the default positions of your PowerPoint shapes.</p>
<p>The control of the objects is very granular its therefore very important to set up functions to standardise some layouts or shapes you want to insert. This speeds up the presentation building process as usually slides tend to borrow a lot of the same code.</p>
<p>The PowerPoint functions I write are imported from a separate .py file. A global function file helps us share the functions to any python script involving presentation automation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Python-pptx works in similar fashion to xlsxwriter. Every time the script is run, a brand new presentation file will be built from scratch.</em></p>

</p>
<p>Routine emails sent on a recurring basis can be automated using the python library smtplib.</p>
<p>We can borrow the SMTP protocol to send our emails and we can avoid our GUI email environment entirely. Python acts as the interface and can send the email directly.</p>
<p>The script can be designed to have a message template built into itself. Additionally, we can make a list of tuples containing the addresses and attachments you want to send to the respective parties.</p>
<p>By looping over these templates and lists, we can entirely bypass the requirement of building all the components for all the emails.</p>
<p>Tens of emails can be sent out in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h1>
<p>Considering the tasks we do daily,weekly and monthly; we can tie our procedures together with an elaborate series of Python tools to save hundreds, if not thousands of hours.</p>
<p>For most organisations, the cost benefit ratio is extremely favourable if automation systems are applied (and maintained) correctly.</p>
<p>The value of your time increases exponentially as you are able to prioritise resources in creating higher quality work.</p>
