      <title>Cyber Deck Assembly - Raspberry Pi</title>

      <description>Summary I&amp;rsquo;ve designed out a &amp;ldquo;cyber deck&amp;rdquo;/frame for my Raspberry Pi to convert it into a usable personal computer. It features a 7 inch touch display and a web camera plugged into the boards DSI (Display Serial Interface) connectors. Should the design become more compact in the future, the ribbon cables are ideal for routing inside tight enclosures.
The only necessary wired connection is a USB-C to provide power to the board.</description>

      <description>Summary This project has been made to practise the use of sending instructions to various electronics for both the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.
I&amp;rsquo;ve segmented this project into two parts/versions:
Arduino - Mouse Control via Serial Communications Port Raspberry Pi - Mouse Control via Python Tkinter Program Arduino The arduino project is very simple, there is a program written in Processing which takes the mouse inputs send strings (enclosed in &amp;lt;&amp;gt;) to the Arduino via serial communications.</description>

      <title>3D Printed RC Road Vehicle</title>

      <description>Summary Finshed designing and building a functional 3D Printed RC car which accidently ended up resembling a tractor by chance. Thats the consequence of a lack of planning and design contraints&amp;hellip;
The reason for the large wheels in the back is because of how I started my design process. The design was built around the gearbox. Since the gearbox ended up being very tall, I figured I would just mount some very large wheels to clear the ground.</description>

      <title>Lithophane Lamp</title>
      <link>https://filpill.github.io/eng_projects/litho/</link>

      <guid>https://filpill.github.io/eng_projects/litho/</guid>
      <description>Summary Designed a 3D printed lithophane lamp in Soldworks. Main feature: Replaceable lithophanes of chosen standard of aspect ratio/dimension. Features Top/Bottom Panels retained with three M3 screws &amp;ndash; Removing the panels gives access to replacing the printed lithophane. Wiring threads through back of assembly and socket leans on back the back panel. Forward attachment clamps the socket and constrains the foward movement of the light socket with screws. I have two slightly different designs to accomadate either an E14 lamp socket or an E27 lamp socket.</description>

      <title>UAV Aircraft Design</title>
      <link>https://filpill.github.io/eng_projects/uav/</link>

      <guid>https://filpill.github.io/eng_projects/uav/</guid>
      <description>Summary My elected project for my 4th year in University was to design and build a UAV aircraft. The design requirements were driven out from the 2017 BMFA competition (Payload Challenge). The design had to be capable of flying some circuits with varying volumes of water weighing up to 3.5kg. As project engineer, I was responsible for coordinating the technical requirements and outputs between our sub-teams. Previous Next &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; / [pdf] View the PDF file here.</description>

      <title>Forward Facing Step - Particle Image Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://filpill.github.io/eng_projects/piv/</link>

      <description>Summary My 3rd year project in University was to design a Forward Facing Step and perform wind tunnel experiments to analyse flow characteristics on that geometry using PIV.
Particle Image Velocimetry is a practical tool for Aerodynamics analyse flow fields without intrusions in the wind tunnel environment such as sensors or pitot probes.
In this experiment the height of the boundary layer is similarly proportioned to the height of the step.</description>
