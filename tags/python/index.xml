      <description>Summary I am always spotting oppertunities to streamline processes and alleviate the burden from our day to day work.
This article serves as an example for the wide ranging applications I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Python to automate both simple and complex tasks with high efficiency.
Data Transformation &amp;amp; Processing System These are some of the goals we are trying to achieve:
To build complete end-to-end data solutions from source to user. We want to minimise manual task inputs during the data processing.</description>

      <description>Codewars Profile Filpill - Codewars Profile
What is Codewars? A website that provides challenges for you to solve in a variety of programming languages. The higher the rank of the problem, the harder it is to solve.
Motivation Recently I was feeling inspired to try and improve my existing programming skills. I am specifically focusing on improving my fundamental knoweldge of Python.
The majority of my learning process so far has been based on my independant project based learning.</description>

      <title>Age of Empire 2 API - Data Visualisation</title>

      <description>Summary I decided to showcase some data transformations on I game that usually play and see if I could get some cool visualisations/insights. I&amp;rsquo;m using an API to replicate a sample of data visualisations I would typically make. In my work I normally query out of a SQL database for my data ingestion but trying something new here as an experiment. This was my first time using an API to extract JSON data, but its very easy to manipulate on Python to transform into a dict/dataframe.</description>

      <description>Summary Re-writing 2D heat transfer simulation designed in MATLAB to Python. Solved using Successive Over Relaxation Algorithm and Finite Difference Method used to capture incremental changes of temeperature on grid. Animated the heat transitions in Python at each timestep using FuncAnimation component of matplotlib. LHS boundaries on the mesh and the application of the heat input on the leftmost nodes. Heat Input lasts 2 seconds in resulting simulation before being turned off.</description>

      <title>Forward Facing Step - Particle Image Velocimetry</title>

      <description>Summary My 3rd year project in University was to design a Forward Facing Step and perform wind tunnel experiments to analyse flow characteristics on that geometry using PIV.
Particle Image Velocimetry is a practical tool for Aerodynamics analyse flow fields without intrusions in the wind tunnel environment such as sensors or pitot probes.
In this experiment the height of the boundary layer is similarly proportioned to the height of the step.</description>
