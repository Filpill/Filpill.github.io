      <description>Codewars Badge Predominantly solving Python and SQL problems
Codewars profile: Filpill - Codewars Profile
What is Codewars? A website that provides challenges for you to solve in a variety of programming languages. The higher the rank of the problem, the harder it is to solve.
Rank System Ranks are used to indicate the proficiency of users and the difficulty of Kata. There are two classes of ranks, Kyu and Dan, which are divided in 8 levels each.</description>

      <title>Age of Empire 2 API - Data Visualisation</title>

      <description>Summary  I decided to showcase some data transformations on I game that usually play and see if I could get some cool visualisations/insights. I&amp;rsquo;m using an API to replicate a sample of data visualisations I would typically make. In my work I normally query out of a SQL database for my data ingestion but trying something new here as an experiment. This was my first time using an API to extract JSON data, but its very easy to manipulate on Python to transform into a dict/dataframe.</description>

      <title>2D Heat Transfer Simulation</title>

      <description>Summary  Re-writing 2D heat transfer simulation designed in MATLAB to Python. Solved using Successive Over Relaxation Algorithm and Finite Difference Method used to capture incremental changes of temeperature on grid. Animated the heat transitions in Python at each timestep using FuncAnimation component of matplotlib. LHS boundaries on the mesh and the application of the heat input on the leftmost nodes. Heat Input lasts 2 seconds in resulting simulation before being turned off.</description>

      <title>Forward Facing Step - Particle Image Velocimetry</title>

      <description>Summary   My 3rd year project in University was to design a Forward Facing Step and perform wind tunnel experiments to analyse flow characteristics on that geometry using PIV.
  Particle Image Velocimetry is a practical tool for Aerodynamics analyse flow fields without intrusions in the wind tunnel environment such as sensors or pitot probes.
  In this experiment the height of the boundary layer is similarly proportioned to the height of the step.</description>
