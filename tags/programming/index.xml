      <title>Tableau Client Server API: Extracting Dashboard Images</title>
      <link>https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/tableauapi/</link>

      <description>Summary I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the process of developing numerous Tableau dashboards across different areas of the airline business to share safety data across the organisation.
However, there is no easy way to download all the various charts from dashboard views you have produced to recycle for the purpose of a powerpoint presentation.
Ideally we want to avoid duplicating the data analytics process in other systems such as Python as we don&amp;rsquo;t want to incur uncessary work to present the same information.</description>

      <title>Chess.com API - Data Visualisation</title>
      <link>https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/chess/</link>

      <description>Summary I&amp;rsquo;ve played a decent number of chess games on the chess.com platform since 2019 and all my chess data can be explored using the API endpoints documented inside the website.
I was interested in monitoring how my rating has changed over the cumalative number of games played.
I was playing chess casually so my improvement was marginal compared to the upper echelon of chess skill. Additionally, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t learning chess strategy or tactics in depth.</description>

      <title>Building Data Pipelines With Python: Systems Perspective</title>

      <description>Summary There are endless oppertunities to streamline processes and automate our data production tasks.
This article serves as an example for the wide ranging applications I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Python to automate both simple and complex tasks with high efficiency.
Data Modelling These are some of the goals we are trying to achieve:
To build complete end-to-end data solutions from the data source to user. We want to minimise manual task interventions during the data processing.</description>

      <title>Github - Command Line Interface Procedures</title>

      <description>Summary Documenting the most common ways I interact with git and in maintaining my programs. For reference these actions are performed via the command line.
In my opinion the main benefit of using a CLI is the added efficiency of the scripting out the majority of the process via usage of shell scripts.
This allows you to direct all of your attention on effortless creating work without getting lost in a GUI just to push a new commit.</description>

      <title>Valorant API - Web Scraping Project</title>
      <link>https://filpill.github.io/data_projects/val_scrp/</link>

      <description>Summary I was searching for a Valorant API to collect and analyse some of my own match data. However the developers are not providing personal API keys for this particular game.
There are some websites which are publishing the Valorant data into the public domain. I decided to scrape my own match data which is being hosted on their web clients.
Though the volume of data highlighted on the website is limited compared to the actual volume of games I&amp;rsquo;ve played.</description>

      <title>Age of Empire 2 API - Data Visualisation</title>

      <description>Summary I decided to showcase some data transformations on I game that usually play and see if I could get some cool visualisations/insights. I&amp;rsquo;m using an API to replicate a sample of data visualisations I would typically make. In my work I normally query out of a SQL database for my data ingestion but trying something new here as an experiment. This was my first time using an API to extract JSON data, but its very easy to manipulate on Python to transform into a dict/dataframe.</description>

      <title>3D Printed Car - Bluetooth Controller Interface</title>

      <description>Summary Personal project to design and build a 3D printed car from scratch. Project status is currently dormant as I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to iterate over the design due to the complexity and required time investment. The project was gradually being built over the course of 2020 and 2021. Though incomplete, I may return to this project at a later stage (with a smaller scope) after finishing some other projects. The project requires some simplification for the desired goal of having a robust car design.</description>

      <title>2D Heat Transfer Simulation</title>
      <link>https://filpill.github.io/eng_projects/ht_sim/</link>

      <guid>https://filpill.github.io/eng_projects/ht_sim/</guid>
      <description>Summary Re-writing 2D heat transfer simulation designed in MATLAB to Python. Solved using Successive Over Relaxation Algorithm and Finite Difference Method used to capture incremental changes of temeperature on grid. Animated the heat transitions in Python at each timestep using FuncAnimation component of matplotlib. LHS boundaries on the mesh and the application of the heat input on the leftmost nodes. Heat Input lasts 2 seconds in resulting simulation before being turned off.</description>
