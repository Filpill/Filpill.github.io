      <title>Age of Empire 2 API - Data Visualisation</title>

      <description>Summary  This project was prompted by the fact that I cannot share any data from my personal work. I decided to showcase some data transformations on I game that usually play and see if I could get some cool visualisations/insights. As such I searched out for an API to replicate my data visualisation experience. Although this is only a fraction the the analysis I would typically do. In my work I normally query out of a SQL database for my data ingestion.</description>

      <description>Summary  Personal project to design and build a 3D printed car from scratch. Project status is currently dormant as I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to iterate over the design due to the complexity and required time investment.  The project was gradually being built over the course of 2020 and 2021. Though incomplete, I may return to this project at a later stage (with a smaller scope) after finishing some other projects.</description>

      <title>2D Heat Transfer Simulation</title>

      <description>Summary  Re-writing 2D heat transfer simulation designed in MATLAB to Python. Solved using Successive Over Relaxation Algorithm and Finite Difference Method used to capture incremental changes of temeperature on grid. Animated the heat transitions in Python at each timestep using FuncAnimation component of matplotlib. LHS boundaries on the mesh and the application of the heat input on the leftmost nodes. Heat Input lasts 2 seconds in resulting simulation before being turned off.</description>
