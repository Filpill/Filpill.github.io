      <description>Introduction After installing a fresh copy of Arch Linux, you are probably wanting to get around to setting up some type of graphical environment.
A black terminal screen is not necessarily conducive to an enjoyable Linux desktop experience.
It can be difficult to setup a graphical environment for the first time if there is not much guidance. A lot of Linux advice can be very scattershot, and leaving most people quite lost.</description>

      <description>Why Share Files Directly Between Windows and Linux? Why share files between these two different operating systems? A redundant system, no?
I think not.
I&amp;rsquo;ll share my reasons why here:
I have 2 seperate workstreams for windows and linux respectively on my PC: Certain tasks are more optimal to do on windows e.g. CAD, video/photo editting etc. Other tasks are more optimally accomplished on linux software: file management, code development etc.</description>

      <description>Summary This article documents how to remotely access your Raspberry Pi using either Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
The benefit of remote access is that you do not need to constantly plug in a wired keyboard and mouse to do some configuration on your Pi devices.
The SSH access is ideal for cases with exclusive involvement of the terminal. The remote desktop acess is requied for situations using the graphical desktop environment.</description>

      <description>Introduction This guide details the installation procdure of Arch onto a Virtual Machine (VM). Network configuration is not in the scope of this guide if you are installing on bare metal.
The motivation behind this web page is to keep some guidance material for myself and also for anybody new looking to install Arch from scratch.
The virtual machine is made with Microsofts Hyper-V program. The steps may differ slightly if you choose to use a another hypervisor such as VirtualBox.</description>
