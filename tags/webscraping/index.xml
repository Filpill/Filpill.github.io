      <description>Summary I&amp;rsquo;ve played a fair amount of chess on the chess.com platform since 2019 and fortunately all my chess data can be explored using the API endpoints documented inside the website.
I&amp;rsquo;ve was interested in seeing how my rating has changed over time from a graphical perspective.
Though, I didn&amp;rsquo;t make much improvement given that I was playing chess casuallly and was not learning chess strategy in depth.

      <description>Summary I was searching for a Valorant API to collect and analyse some of my own match data. However the developers are not providing personal API keys for this particular game.
There are some websites which are publishing the Valorant data into the public domain. I decided to scrape my own match data which is being hosted on their web clients.
Though the volume of data highlighted on the website is limited compared to the actual volume of games I&amp;rsquo;ve played.</description>
