      <description>Summary My elected project for my 4th year in University was to design and build a UAV aircraft. The design requirements were driven out from the 2017 BMFA competition (Payload Challenge). The design had to be capable of flying some circuits with varying volumes of water weighing up to 3.5kg. As project engineer, I was responsible for coordinating the technical requirements and outputs between our sub-teams. Link to Project Report Aircraft Design Process The aircraft design process used in this project is an adaptation of the design process learnt in university for commercial passenger aircraft design.</description>
