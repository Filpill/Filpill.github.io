      <description>Summary The purpose of this page is to document the most common ways I interact with git and in maintaining my programs. These actions are performed via the command line as per how the tool was originally designed.
In my opinion the main benefit is the added efficiency of the scripting out the majority of the CLI commands via a series of shell scripts.
This simply allows you to direct all of your attention on creating better quality work without getting lost in a GUI most of the time.</description>
